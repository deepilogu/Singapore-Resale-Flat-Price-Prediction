# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, assisting potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Motivation

The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and accurately estimating the resale value of a flat can be challenging. A predictive model can help overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on various factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration.

## Scope

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to the present. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
  
- **Model Selection and Training:** Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests). Train the model on the historical data.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.
  
- **Streamlit Web Application:** Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat and predicts the resale price based on user inputs.
  
- **Deployment:** Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
