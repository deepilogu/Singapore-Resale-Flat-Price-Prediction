# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, assisting potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.
